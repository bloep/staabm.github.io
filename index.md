### Hi there 👋

My name is Markus and I am a open source enthusiast since 2008 ✨.

I am the developer behind `cs2pr`, `phpstan-dba` and a few more projects.

For fun and educating myself I actively contribute to various projects - [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src), [filp/whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops), [sabre/dav](https://github.com/sabre-io/dav), [stomp-php](https://github.com/stomp-php/stomp-php), [propelorm](https://github.com/propelorm) - to name a few of them.

I am curious and reading a lot regarding latest web technologies, web standards and browser development. My passion is working on performance problems and figuring out crazy bugs 🐜.

In case I was able to help you out with my contributions in the past, [please consider supporting my work with your sponsoring 💕](https://github.com/sponsors/staabm)
