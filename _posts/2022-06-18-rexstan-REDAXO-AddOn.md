### About REDAXO

The REDAXO CMS is a open source content managment system mainly used from developers in germany.

Its main advantage over other systems in the field is the different approach on building websites.
In contrast to most other systems REDAXO is a kind of microframework which brings a few loosely coupled building blocks.

It is a very minimal system by default but can easily be extended by installing AddOns, depending on your needs.
Because of this bottom-up approach you get a very slim and fast system, which can be customized in nearly every aspect.

The system is usually used by web developers to built a website or web-based tool for the actual customer and their endusers.
