### phpstan-dba is adopted by popular projects

Recently I learned [phpstan-dba](https://staabm.github.io/2022/05/01/phpstan-dba.html) is [used by some popular projects](https://github.com/staabm/phpstan-dba/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0yOTY1ODA1ODA4).

[packagist.org - the main Composer repository](https://packagist.org/) uses it in its [continous integration pipeline](https://github.com/composer/packagist)

[Shopware - an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue](https://github.com/shopware/platform)

Maybe its the time you should also give it a try ;-)
